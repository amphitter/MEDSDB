# **MEDSDB - Hospital Management System**

## **Overview**

MEDSDB is a cutting-edge Hospital Management System (HMS) designed to digitize and streamline hospital operations, from patient records and billing to administrative tasks and beyond. MEDSDB aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of healthcare providers, reduce operational costs, and improve patient care by providing a unified digital platform that manages all aspects of hospital administration.

## **Project Status**

MEDSDB is currently under active development. The core features are being implemented, and the system architecture is being designed to support scalability and future integrations. As the project progresses, updates will be made to this README file to reflect the latest developments.

## **Features (Under Development)**

- **Admin Dashboard**: A comprehensive interface for managing hospital operations, including patient data, appointments, billing, and staff management.
- **Patient Management**: Tools for adding, updating, and managing patient records, including personal information, medical history, and current treatment plans.
- **Billing and Financial Management**: Automated billing generation, payment processing, and financial reporting.
- **Data Storage and Management**: A centralized database to securely store and manage patient and hospital data, with backup and recovery features.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Customizable reports and analytics tools to help administrators make data-driven decisions.
- **User Management**: Role-based access control to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.

## **Future Integrations**

- **Centralized Server Integration**: A planned feature to connect all hospital operations to a centralized server, eliminating the need for paper records. This integration will allow real-time communication between departments, with digital patient cards being used to manage and update patient information.

## **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js
- **Backend**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Security**: JWT for authentication
